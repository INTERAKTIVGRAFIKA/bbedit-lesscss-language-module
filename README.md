bbedit-lesscss-language-module
==============================

{less} language module for BBEdit.

This is a [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) Language 
Module for [{lesscss}](http://lesscss.org/) providing syntax hilighting.

This is currently a work-in-progress, so not every less-feature is reflected in 
syntax coloring.

Installation:
-------------
- Move LESS.plist to ~/Library/Application\ Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/
- Restart BBEdit
- Code {less} css.
